Before proceeding with it, one cannot resist addressing a frequently 
asked question concerning when it should be undertaken. 
Yes, it is always at the first stages but lets talk about its focus.

Very often the question is asked;

Should the dataset be split before undertaking the exploratory analysis?

Should exploratory analysis be undertaken on all the dataset or only the training dataset?

Well, these two questions are driving at the same thing from the same angle.

The answers are Yes and No with solid arguemnt for both so that it all truns down to be 
where you see things from base on your situation. I will argue for each point to present 
the views based on which you decide.


Yes, the dataset should be split before exploratory analysis!
Exploratory analysis should be based on only training data!
